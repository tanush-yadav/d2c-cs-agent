- Improved error output for debugging
- Added better git ignores
- Added documentation for contributors

## Changed Files

1. **Configuration**
   - Added `src/config/environment.ts` for centralized environment management
   - Added configuration validation using Zod

2. **Utilities**
   - Added `src/utils/logger.ts` for improved logging

   - Created `src/tools/order-tools.ts` for order-related functionality
   - More tool modules can be added in a similar pattern

4. **Development Setup**
   - Added `.eslintrc.json` for code quality rules
   - Added `.prettierrc` for code formatting rules
   - Improved `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
   - Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidelines

5. **Main Application**

## Next Steps

The following areas could be improved in future iterations:

1. Add more comprehensive tests for all functionality
2. Implement caching for frequently used data
3. Add retry mechanisms for API calls
4. Implement connection pooling for better performance
5. Split remaining large modules into smaller, focused components
6. Improve documentation with JSDoc throughout the codebase
7. Add API request/response cycle logging
8. Implement automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
